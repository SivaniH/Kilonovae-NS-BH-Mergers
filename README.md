# Kilonovae-NS-BH-Mergers

	Utilised the software MOSFiT to fabricate large data samples of kilonovae based on predefined models by changing specific parameter values obtained from various literature sources.
	Generated light-curve models of simulated kilonovae from the mergers, making it easier to understand their properties such as the magnitudes at which they are expected to peak, and the times that provide the best chances of detection.
	Produced two different models of binary neutron stars by varying the mass distributions and comparing the results to get a broader understanding of the features of the transients produced.
	Assessed the detectability of these phenomena by considering past and future surveys and comparing them with the results obtained in this project.
